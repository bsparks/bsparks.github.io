      <description>&lt;p&gt;Well I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking about switching from Wordpress to a static site generator for some time. Now I&amp;rsquo;ve done it.
There are several generators out there, but I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to go with &lt;a href=&#34;http://hugo.spf13.com/&#34;&gt;Hugo&lt;/a&gt;.
I don&amp;rsquo;t really get all that much benefit from the WYSIWYG aspects of Wordpress, and it just opens up yourself to hacking and spam because of the ability to
edit online. I&amp;rsquo;m also not a huge fan of PHP, though the application has served me well enough for years I suppose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another reason is that it&amp;rsquo;ll force me to really grok markdown. So I decided to port all (most) of my older posts over from
Wordpress. Sadly, I haven&amp;rsquo;t found a faster way to do it other than manually. The good news is that I never had all that many entries :)
Oh and it helps that markdown and html are just fine together.&lt;/p&gt;
