      <description>&lt;p&gt;I gave a talk today at the &lt;a href=&#34;http://nov2011.desertcodecamp.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Desert Code Camp&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=&#34;http://nov2011.desertcodecamp.com/session/398&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;XNA 4.0 Development Basics&lt;/a&gt;. It was my first time presenting at any sort of event. I think overall it went pretty well, tho I had a few issues. The talk was only an hour long, and I found myself being able to cover less than I had thought. I think that in the near future I will be posting some tutorials based around this, so stay tuned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to all those who attended, as promised here are the &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.google.com/open?id=0B6DOWf9Gtu5PZmI0NjAwNjItYmYwYS00NTk3LWFlNTQtNzdkYjBmNTg1NDgx&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;materials&lt;/a&gt; from the talk.&lt;/p&gt;
